# Welcome to the Simple Discord Bot
I basically use this Repo as a small tutorial. Trying to learn the basics of Discord Bot programming.  

### Before you launch yourself!
It is important, that you create your own Bot by creating a New Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications.  
Afterwards go to the "Bot" Section and create the Bot.  
Finally it is important to press "Reset Token" to receive your token for your Bot.  
Put this token now into the token file. Now you're able to launch the bot!
